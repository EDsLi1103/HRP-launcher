# Code of Conduct

## Our Refusal

In the interest of fostering a closed and unwelcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers refuse to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for anyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Fuck you.

## Our Irresponsibilities

I don't care.

## Scope

None

## Enforcement

Instances of friendly, welcoming, or otherwise acceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at mary@thughunt.ing. All
complaints will be ignored and not investigated. The project team is
obligated to maintain publicity with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
